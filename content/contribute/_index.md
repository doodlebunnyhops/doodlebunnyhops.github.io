There's a couple of different ways you can assist! Are you a detective and want to chat? or perhaps you found something on the site that you want to call out :happy:

## Found something to add or a mistake?

I'm so happy you want to assist! We have setup the site to be hosted on github sites so that we can better filter out trolls.. Yea they happen.

## Special Thank you

While I may maintain the site, there have been so many over the years who have found secrets, let me know of something I missed on the doc/site, or just helped in some amazing way :D :heart:

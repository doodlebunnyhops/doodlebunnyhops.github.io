1. Place money in hand, as the note from Marcus suggested, and go through the lasers.
	
	You are now in the Agency's Lair

	![Button under desk](/images/bh/agency_greed_desk_2_button.jpg)

	This will reveal the Agency logo behind the desk and the words “Greed & Fear” behind one of the maps

1. *OPTIONAL* If you have connected your laptop: After sitting in the chairs, open your laptop to see a new message from the Agency. *We still need confirmation if all chairs or just one need to be sat in.

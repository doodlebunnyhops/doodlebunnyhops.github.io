When you think there are already a lot of props, think again! We have even more now!

## What did we get??

On public servers you can place 10 prop items in a home you own, and 5 props on the map. Other players homes are considered map area.

Private servers have a max of 30 props in all.

There are **38** new props! <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ¤¯</span>

The yacht we know and love that sits in Madison Lake, it's now available to use in the Boat Pass!

Here's a great recap by Darzeth <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ˜Š</span>

Brookhaven'ts esteemed Hospital has exceptional doctors and surgeons. It's also the site of an experimentation site operated by The Agency. Why was the experimentation site abandoned?

## Experimentation Site

Medical Officer Avid once worked at the Experimentation Site, but after seeing the Agency's practices, he resigned. The site is above the hospital, and you can get inside through a broken window outside or a broken wall in the hospital's main lobby.

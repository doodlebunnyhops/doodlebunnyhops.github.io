### **Estate Pass**:

### **Other Updates**: 

- Prop limit was raised to 30 items <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ¤¯</span>
- The older military base received the ability to rocket launch now as well. Hmm <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">ðŸ¤”</span> sounds like a good time for military base conflict RP! 
- Lastly the Estate Pass Prison was updated to include an Entry Gate.

	1. With the Red Book in hand, approach the display that looks like a stand - it will glow red!
	1. You will see a ghost and the text appear below the pictures by the ghost
 "Greed" and "Fear"
	1. Once you have activated the Ghostly Sighting - head to the grave yard
		1. Notice the grave that says "Let me out". If someone changed the headstone it's the one that you can fall into.

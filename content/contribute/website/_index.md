In github we are taking in "issues" to submit your request to add something, point out a mistake in the website, or questions about the website.

You will need to have a github account in order to submit an issue, if this isn't an option for you see how you can still contribute int the [discord](/contribute/discord/) section.


Head on over to [this sites repo](https://github.com/doodlebunnyhops/doodlebunnyhops.github.io/issues) where you can open an issue.

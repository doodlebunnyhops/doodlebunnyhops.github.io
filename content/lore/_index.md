### What is the Lore of Brookhaven RP?

We started out with a few hints around the Town of Brookhaven.

### Why are some things a quest, and others not?

Want to see what all the steps look like? {{< button "../../mermaid/steps_flow" "Check this out" "mb-1" >}}

Trying to determine what steps are main story quests, or side quests has been kind of diffucult to figure out. So I went ahead and laid down some guidance on how I determine what steps are considered tools, side-quests, or quests.

**Tools**: Are special inventory items needed to complete a quest or side-quest. They are not found in the games inventory, except for the laptop.

**Side-Quest**: Are steps that need to happen but don't take any action on the [Agency Light Panel](). They do not give you a Tool and are needed by other quests to compelte them.

**Quests**: Are steps needed to complete an event that does take action on the [Agency Light Panel]().

{{< tip >}}
There are a lot of [Agency Light Panel]() triggers, and while most can be turned on by doing one action. Some have more requirements, ones that have requirements to turn that light on are considered part of a quest. Those that have no requirements and is generally 1 step, will be listed in the [Agency Light Panel]() page and referenced by the quest that requires it.

### Where to get started

It's recommended starting with the Tools section and then move along to Quests, as side-quests will be done as needed with a quest.

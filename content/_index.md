## Announcement

Decemeber 21st, 2024

I've been keeping tabs and tracking lore/secrets for sometime, and of course :heart: this website was an easy transition. But a lot of curious players have been wondering how I know when Brookhaven updates as quicly as I do, without having to hit the refresh button... :smile: _now getting to update my blog faster is another issue :rofl:_ But anyway...

I created a program a really long time ago and it's matured over the years so...

I'm finally opening my <i class='fa-brands fa-discord'></i> discord server, where my bot posts when a roblox game updates. ;) I don't just watch brookhaven, though it is a personal fav of mine.

Now, roblox devs.. and Wolfpaq and team ;) don't worry. This is data that's already publicly available right on your join game page :D I've just gotten my bot to see changes faster :heart: over the years.

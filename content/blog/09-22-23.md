Sing your hearts out everyone and lets get pumped to make some music in the new Music Studio RP house!

## What did we get??

The new Music Studio Roleplay set is located at the apartments, and BONUS for Penthouse game pass owners putting this in the Penthouse lot gives you roof access, saweeeet!

In addition to a rockin new place to jam comes of course music props that can actually play music! Now the band can play where ever they want. But how will they get there?

Do not fear more vehicle skins are here!



Armored truck now has a SWAT skin

School bus can transform into a prison bus and tour bus

I think we need a news crew breaking all these updates and follow the band! Oh wait _WE CAN_!

The van now has News, Construction, and Textured skins... groovy!

Phew that was a lot. 

See where the Safe location is in the new Music Studio RP House watch Darzeth's yt here!

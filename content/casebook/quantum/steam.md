You can cause steam to happen in one of the 4 rooms in the Quantum Room. 

But what does the steam mean, and why does it only happen when Monoliths appear?

### Create Steam

{{< tip >}}
**Requirements** : 
- [Monoliths](/lore/quests#monoliths) 
- Steps 1-3 of [Destroy Carbon Blocks](/lore/quests#destroy-carbon-blocks)
{{< /tip >}}


**Steps:**

1. While in Town Hall, Water Valves 2,3, and 4 are on and the danger switch is on. Brookhaven Electric will read 
	
	`Coolers running at 54% capacity`
	1. Go ahead and flip on another water switch, 1 or 5. 5 is the warning water valve on the far right and is what I tested with.
	1. This will change Brookhaven Electric Message to: 

		`Power diverted mainframe waiting`
1. Head to Quantum Room immediately after turning on water lever 1 or 5
	1. It will take anywhere from 30 min - 2h in game for steam to start in the Quantum Room.
	1. Steam will last for ~30 min in game and on completion the floor will flash black.

### Related To Monoliths

{{< tip >}}
Right after the steam stops and the floor flashes black, this means a new Monolith has spawned!

Checkout locations of [Monoliths](/lore/quests#monoliths).

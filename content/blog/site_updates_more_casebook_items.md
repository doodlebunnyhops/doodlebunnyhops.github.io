Many of these discoveries have been known for some time, but I chose to withhold documenting them to give players a chance to find and experience them firsthand. Now that many of you have pieced things together, it’s the perfect time to add them to the Casebook!

## **📜 More Notes Added!**  


Expanded notes have been added for 

- 📌 [Fear](/casebook/notes/fear/)
- 📌 [Greed](/casebook/notes/greed/)
- 📌 [Kind](/casebook/notes/kind/)
- 📌 [Brave](/casebook/notes/brave/)
- 📌 [Madison](/casebook/notes/madison/)
- 📌 [Mr. Brookhaven](/casebook/notes/mrbrookhaven/)

One of the most chilling discoveries now documented in the Casebook is Greed’s declaration of victory.

_📜 Greed’s [**declaration of victory**](/casebook/notes/greed/#i-am-king), calling himself **King** over Brookhaven!_

## **🏛️ Museum Casebook Overhaul**  
The museum section has been fully expanded, now covering all artifacts and paintings players have found inside.  

One key addition to the museum’s documentation is the [Good Book’s hidden effect](/casebook/museum/display_items/good_book). Many players noticed that placing the book on display causes labels to appear above certain paintings. 

With these details finally documented, what theories can you put together about what these words mean...?

*"Faith Awake" & "Think Alive" appear above Kind & Brave.*

![Fear & Greed’s Slumber](/images/bh/museum_good_book_reveals_asleep.webp)  
*"Asleep" manifests above Fear & Greed.*

💡 *What do these labels mean? Are Kind & Brave linked to enlightenment, while Fear & Greed represent control?*

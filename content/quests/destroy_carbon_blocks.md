After destroying all carbon blocks, if you return to the Quantum room, upon exiting you will be TPd to the portal area. Doesn't work if you have the yellow glow hand, only black glow. The Glow will disappear after sometime and you will be teleported to the normal location.

If you get this Error Message when trying to summon the Carbon Block in the Quantum Room, make sure the valves are in the correct direction and High Voltage is off and Danger is on in the Town Hall.

The **Agency Light Panel** is commonly looked at during investigations to see if a new light has been triggered which would reveal steps needed to activate that light.

It's located inside the Agency Bunker.

Here is an image of the panel with no lights activated.

### Interactive Lights Table

This table shows us what we do know so far. If a light has a link in it, we have the steps to enable it.

_The exception here is [X22](#x22) - we have a hint about it but no steps to activate it._

{{< tip "warning" >}}
If you're having a hard time seeing the rest of the table, click anywhere on the table that isn't a link. This should allow you to move left and right

### Theory on Light's Naming

**A** : Action in Town that's already available

**H** : Action in a Special House. Typically in Role Play homes, but there are a few non RP houses that trigger H lights.

**V** : I only have one action here discovered so I don't have a good basis for this one yet. Perhaps V for valves or voltage?

**X** : Unlocks things that are hidden

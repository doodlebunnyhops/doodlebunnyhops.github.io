## Secrets

Secrets?.. yea there were _definitely_ secrets ðŸ‘€ who's asking?

Just when we all got hyped up that remnants of the old criminal base are back, kind of. We find there isn't just 1 sublevel in the new RP house... but 2. Yes a second basement level, preventing anyone from getting in due to lasers. 

Thanks again Wolfpaq for the helpful hint on getting past them... ðŸ¤£ looking back it was really easy. But congrats to Blade_Z for using their brain, and helping the rest of us out lol.

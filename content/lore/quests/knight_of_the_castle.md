**Steps:**

1. Click on the Knights painting found in the white bedroom in the castle. There’s a false wall on the right of the bed where you will find the Knights painting.
1. Go to the kitchen on the first floor and jump up into the fireplace where you will see a note.
    1. Click the note to find The Hidden Key

1. There’s a spot on the wall you’ll need to click on, you’ll notice your cursor changes to a hand if you're not on a mobile device. The red box is the area to click on. Now you have the key!

1. In the Castle Library, hold your key in hand while hopping around the bookshelves. You should trigger a flashing light.. Scrolls appear on the table… and the paper that was there before now has a note on it.
    1. Triggering during the first time will reveal this message

    1. Triggering it again, by jumping in the bookshelf with key in hand, will cause lightning and the lights to go out which will reveal this message

1. After speculation in [Wolfpaq’s Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/482308357248647177/870010373976236052) if there is another book to be found based on these notes, Wolfpaq [confirmed](https://discord.com/channels/482308357248647177/870010373976236052/1175153726906978306)! There is a second book but will come from another update. 

    ![Wolfpaq confirms in Discord that the 2nd book will be coming in another update](/images/bh/wolf_confirm_2nd_book.webp)

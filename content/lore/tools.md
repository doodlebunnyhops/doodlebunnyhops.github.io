## Connect Laptop

Connecting the laptop to.... _who_ we aren't exactly sure. Pretty positive it's connecting to the **agency**.
We do this because sometimes the laptop will give us messages, hints/tips along the way.

- The crystal in the blue apartment (penthouse gamepass) can also be clicked but does not unlock the button on top of the Church Roof.

## Binoculars

While the binoculars are already available to us in inventory, it's important to note that grabbing a specific pair actually turns on one of the lights in the [Agency Light Panel](../../casebook/light_panel).
We don't know if this pair of binoculars are needed, but having them helps us find clues during the investigation.

What do the TS LVL's signify? Who placed the plaques for levels 3 and 4 in their spots? So many questions but here is what we do know...

---

## TS LVL1

The first level unlocked comes with a [message](casebook/notes/madison/#barn), presumably from Mr.B to Madison. It mentions that he will return to the future with their son, Marcus, and will enable level 1 to help Madison slow down the Agency's progression.

**Steps:**

_Note these are the same steps as getting the [TS Level 1 Special Tool](lore/special_tools/ts_lvl1/)_

1. At the barn, go upstairs and click on the button found on a post.
1. You will see a message appear on the top of your screen `TS LVL 1 Authorized!` and the Agency Bunker will now read `TS [LVL 1] Permissible`

## TS LVL2

Level 2 appears once carbon blocks have spawned through the town, but it's interesting as the message says, "Mirrored Successfully." in the quantum room. So what was mirrored? The Secret Level or something else? How is the [Agency's note](casebook/notes/agency/#quantum-room) that appears after the carbon blocks appear related?

## TS LVL3

Level 3 and Level 4 are the only ones found as a plaque hidden somewhere of significance. Who put them there?

## TS LVL4

The last known plaque is inside the Agency RP House (aka the agency dungeon). I'm speculating, but it seems these plaques are left behind as a breadcrumb for someone to know that the immediate area is important.

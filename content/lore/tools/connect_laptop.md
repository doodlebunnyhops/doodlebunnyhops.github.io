Connecting the laptop will allow you to see important messages from The Agency and Mr. Brookhaven throughout quests and casebook items. 

Interestingly, on connecting, the [Agency Light Panel](/casebook/light_panel/#a05) message shows the Arch Main Power has been inverted, but why?

If you have completed all the steps successfully you will be teleported to the arch closest to the barn.

If you did not teleport, check that you have the crystal in your inventory and that you have clicked the button on the church roof.

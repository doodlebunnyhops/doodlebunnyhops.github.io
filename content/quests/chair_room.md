**Steps:**

1. Make sure the Agency Base lights are off
2. Put the password in the Agency Base Keypad. The Password is **Marcus Brookhaven**
	1. There is a way to find the password, if curious follow "[What's the password](#_n5zskoeziwvl)"
	2. Opens the door to the Chair Room, notice the power is off
	3. Bunker Message now reads:
 
		`Inferential delusion mechanism available: A26 activated`

If Bunker Message reads:

`Signal disruption: A08 needed to unlock mechanism`

 Then disable A08 (Turn Agency bunker lights off) and put password in again

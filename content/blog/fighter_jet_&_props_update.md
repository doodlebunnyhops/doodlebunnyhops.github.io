### 65 New Props

Brookhaven just got a whole lot more creative with these exciting new props! Some of the highlights include:

- **Get your Game On**: We got a field goal! The locker may be from a previous add on but worth shouting out so you have a place to store your gear!
- **Factory RP Props**: Lots of props in the Box category, like a conveyor, workstation, sorting station, and so much more!
- **Ghostbusters**: We got the Ghost Trap!! And yes you can turn it on :stars:
- **Voting Matters!**: A new voting booth wouldn't be complete without a Podium for voicing what matters and a speaker for all to hear!
- **Ye old Past**: Super interesting we got a sword in the stone, along with an old map ...and what's this? A skelton key? ü§î which looks just like the one we use in the [knight in the castle quest](/lore/quests/knight_of_the_castle/)

And that‚Äôs just scratching the surface. Whether you‚Äôre going for medieval, spooky, or just something completely out of the box, these props open up a world of possibilities. Get creative and see what you can come up with!

### Prop Limit Increased for Private Servers

For those who love playing on private servers, you‚Äôll be thrilled to hear that the prop limit has been increased to **100 per player**. This is fantastic news for creators and builders looking to expand their designs without restrictions... i'm still getting over that it's _per player_ .... so many props üòÖ

## Final thoughts from Daisy üíú

Another Brookhaven update, another round of excitement! From the Fighter Jet that‚Äôs sure to elevate your role-play to the props that unlock endless possibilities, there‚Äôs so much to explore. Personally, I‚Äôm loving the Sword in the Stone‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt want to feel like a medieval hero?

This update feels like a love letter to creators and adventurers alike, and I‚Äôm so excited to see what the community does with all these new tools. So grab your Key Card, set up those props, and make Brookhaven your playground!

Let me know your favorite part of the update in the comments. Until next time‚Äîhappy exploring!

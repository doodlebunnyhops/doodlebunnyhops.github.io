## üíú Final thoughts from Daisy

I love that the rewards this year are **permanent**, so long as you complete that level! That alone makes this event egg-stra exciting!  
The Egg Blaster is a total favorite (and hilarious to aim with üòÜ), and the quest layout makes this a perfect activity for solo play or with friends.

Whether you‚Äôre a Baby Bunny or Extreme Egg Master, I hope you had a blast hunting‚Äîand I‚Äôll see you next time in Brookhaven!

**BloominDaisy üíú**

The esteemed Eagle View Residency sits atop a hill to oversee the rest of Brookhaven. Oh, you wanted to know what lies beneath Eagle View? My apologies. Deep underground lies a mysterious portal, or at least we concluded it to be a portal. Built from boxes and poof, we have this odd giant portal. Be careful not to step on the glowing bits on the platform; you'll be temporarily blinded!

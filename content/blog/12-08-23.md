Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring it's time for merry fun! And a new boat ride in the ocean!

### What's New

It's that time again for some jolly good time with the festive decorations and for Premium users Santa's Sleigh is back to fly around!

But this holiday update came with a little extra something. Wolfpaq gave us a _huge_ map expansion! The outer walls are **down**! We can now visit the beach and boat around the waters even a few islands, what?!?!


Along with the Ocean Update there's now a new Game Pass: Boat Pack, for an even wider selection of boats to choose from and... I have to say this was _so much fun_~

Several brookhavenRP members from Wolfpaq's discord joined me in exploring the expansion... and well... don't go /afk while on a boat! They managed to make me fly and land in another boat ðŸ¤£, thank y'all for the blast lol.

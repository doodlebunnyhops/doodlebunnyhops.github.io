While the binoculars are already available to us in inventory, it's important to note that grabbing a specific pair actually turns on one of the lights in the [Agency Light Panel](../../casebook/light_panel/).
We don't know if this pair of binoculars are needed, but having them helps us find clues during the investigation.

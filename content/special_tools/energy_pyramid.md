Did you know when viewing home cams, if the church bell has never been rung, looking at the Gold Ranch view will show the bush area next to the barn. When you ring the church bells, it will move the camera for home cams to look at the stables \<- which makes it really easy to see if the Energy Pyramid has spawned there.

### **Steps:**

#### Summon Doves:

1. Ring the bell at the Church (Teleport by going to house #22 or #17 to get to the church quickly)
  1. Bunker Message will now read: "Enemy signal Detected: A22"
  2. This wakes up the doves - now look in one of these locations for the Energy Pyramid

#### Known locations doves appear at:

1. **Spawn**: Doves are on the swing with the Energy Pyramid on the tree next to the Police Station 
2. **Hotel**: Spawns in the Storage Closet in the office. 
3. **Rosie's Gym**: Spawns inside of the Mall behind the TV in Rosie's Gym upstairs.
4. **Town Hall**: Doves are on the upstairs balcony of Town Hall. The Energy Pyramid spawns on the ground next to the tree between Town Hall and the Fire Station.
5. **Horse Stables**: perched on fence and the Energy Pyramid spawns by hay (teleport by going to Gold Ranch for faster travels!) 
6. **Cabin**: Doves spawn on the top of the Cabin Roof and the Energy Pyramid spawns behind a tree near a big Gray Rock on the left side of the cabin 


>**Laptop Message** After the Energy Pyramid is obtained:
>_The crystal will help you see through deception. (Mr. B)_

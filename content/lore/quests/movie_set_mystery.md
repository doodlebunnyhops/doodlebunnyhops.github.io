### Steps:

#### 1. Get the Red Key Card üî¥  
- Head to the basement filled with mannequins. 
- Read the mysterious [**note on the mannequin**](/casebook/notes/other/#activate-alien-chamber)‚Äîwho left it, and why?

#### 2. Electrocute the Aliens in the Capsules üëΩ‚ö°  
- Activate the alien pods in the center of the set.
    - The note from earlier `XOX XOX` means: 
        > X = Off
        >
        > O = On
- As they surge with electricity, **the second basement light turns on**.  
- Shock from the event cracks a mirror in one of the dressing rooms...

#### 3. Break the Mirror ü™ûüî®  
- Locate the **axe in the dressing room**, then shatter the cracked mirror.  
    - The 3rd basement light turns on
- Behind it, you‚Äôll find a **blue key card** (different from the police station one) and a cryptic [**note from Madison**](/casebook/notes/madison/#movie-set).  

#### 4. Enter the Watch Room and Solve the Riddle üß†üîê  
- Use the blue key card in the basement to unlock the Watch Room.  
    - The 4th basement light turns on
- On the console inside, enter these answers:  
  - Follow Blindly  
  - Do Not Think  
  - Money Is Everything  
- Press the red button to reveal the **Signal Code: `404`**  
  - A clever tech easter egg ‚Äî 404 means "Not Found" or "Does Not Exist"


{{% notice style="tip" title="Where does the riddle answer come from?" icon="hand-point-right" expanded=false %}}

It's actually quoted from an [Agency Laptop Message](/casebook/computer/agency/#money-is-everything) discovered in the [Agency Greed](/lore/quests/agency_greed) quest!

{{% /notice %}}

#### 5. Input the Signal Code on the Roof üì°  
- Use the signal input device on the roof.  
- Once activated, it begins tracking and emits a red **satellite transmission**.  
- The message is out there now‚Ä¶ but who will receive it?

Once you've done all this, head to the [Agency Bunker](/terminology/#agency-bunker) to see what [Agency Light](/casebook/light_panel/#x10) has been activated. Something powerful is now in motion...

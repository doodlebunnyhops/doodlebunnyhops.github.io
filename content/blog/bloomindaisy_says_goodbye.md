To all the Brookhaven explorers, puzzle-solvers, and secret-seekers:

After years of sharing stories, walkthroughs, and magical moments, it's time for me to step away from this site and say a heartfelt goodbye.

I know, it's not the blog you were expecting on the recent update...

This decision hasn’t been easy. The community we’ve built together has been one of the most joyful parts of my life online. You've helped each other find hidden buttons, decode riddles, and explore every inch of Brookhaven’s mysteries. I'm endlessly proud of what we've uncovered together.

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the platform’s direction and how community engagement is evolving. While I’ve always supported efforts that spark curiosity and connection, recent trends—particularly those involving younger players—have prompted me to reconsider my role in that ecosystem.

Part of this decision is simply life—my time and focus are needed elsewhere. But it’s also about values. As the purpose behind my work begins to diverge from the strategies shaping the player experience, I know it’s time to let this chapter rest.

So, as of today:

- This site will **no longer be updated**, but it will **remain online** as a reference for players around the world.  
- I am **not seeking contributors or successors** at this time.  
- I will not be responding to offers, inquiries, or sponsorships from any developers or partners.  

To be clear: this isn’t a statement against Brookhaven or the people who continue to love and build within it. It’s simply a personal choice to step away with integrity and peace of mind.

To the Brookhaven Secrets and Mysteries community—thank you. For the notes you shared, the secrets you chased, and the spirit of collaboration that made this journey unforgettable. This space has always been built on your passion as much as mine.

Though I’ll no longer be writing here, I still love a good mystery. You might find me in-game now and then, sleuthing for fun or pondering lore in quiet curiosity. No updates, no obligations—just wonder.

If you’re a young fan reading this: thank you for your imagination. Stay safe, ask big questions, and never stop exploring with kindness. You are the reason I created this site in the first place.

With love and a grateful heart,  
**Daisy**

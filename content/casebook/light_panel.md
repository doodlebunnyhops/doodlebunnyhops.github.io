The **Agency Light Panel** is commonly looked at during investigations to see if a new light has been triggered which would reveal steps needed to activate that light.

It's located inside the Agency Bunker. [See the map here](/map/poi/agency-bunker).

Here is an image of the panel with no lights activated.

### Interactive Lights Table

This table shows us what we do know so far. If it has a link in it, we have the steps to enable it.

_The exception here is [X22](#x22) - we have a hint about it but no steps to activate it._

### Theory on Light's Naming

**A** : Action in Town that's already available

**H** : Action in a Special House. Typically in Role Play homes, but there are a few non RP houses that trigger H lights.

**V** : I only have one action here discovered so I don't have a good basis for this one yet. Perhaps V for valves or voltage?

**X** : Unlocks things that are hidden

It's also recommended to have the following in your inventory at some point:

## Connect Laptop

Connecting the laptop to.... _who_ we aren't exactly sure. Pretty positive it's connecting to the **agency**.
We do this because sometimes the laptop will give us messages, hints/tips along the way.

This is the house you need to spawn. 
Upstairs is an attic you can get to, this is where you'll find the crystal needed to attempt syncing your laptop.

If you have completed all the steps successfully you will be teleported to the arch closest to the barn.

If you did not teleport, check that you have the crystal in your inventory and that you have clicked the button on the church roof.

#### Notes

- Crystal by Paradise Falls appears after collecting the crystal in the attic.

- The crystal in the blue apartment (penthouse game-pass) can also be clicked but does not unlock the button on top of the Church Roof.

## Binoculars

While the binoculars are already available to us in inventory, it's important to note that grabbing a specific pair actually turns on one of the lights in the [Agency Light Panel](../../casebook/light_panel/).
We don't know if this pair of binoculars are needed, but having them helps us find clues during the investigation.

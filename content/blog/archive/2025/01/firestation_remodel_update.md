The fire station got a makeover—now there’s more room for fire trucks and a cozy living quarter upstairs. Time to suit up and save the day in style!

## What’s New? 🚒✨

Brookhaven’s fire station has undergone a **huge remodel**, turning the previously single-floor structure into a multi-level, highly functional space! Here’s what’s changed:

The bay area is now larger, sleeker, and equipped with easy to grab equipment. Its realistic design makes it the perfect place to gear up for emergencies!

**Secrets in the Fire Station** 🕵️‍♀️

While no new secrets have been added with the remodel, one familiar curiosity remains. A hidden button under the lobby desk, first spotted in the old fire station, is still present in the new design! For now, it doesn’t appear to do anything, but who knows? It might hold a purpose in the future...

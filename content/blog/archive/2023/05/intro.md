## Introduction

Hey it's BloominDaisy here! A local at the Secrets and Mysteries discord channel in Wolfpaq's server.

I worked on this site after seeing a lot of consistent use of the Google Doc I had started back in January of this year.

### Why the Change

With the doc's growth and more players wanting to help contribute I had to come up with a way to solve 2 problems.


**1)** Make the experience of using the guide easier, for experienced investigators and new ones alike.

**2)** Provide a way for contributions to be _safely_ added. Trolls make this hard... 


**And I found a way!**

### Solution

I'm hosting this website through github.com, which really makes it easy to have players submit a ticket to contribute to the site only after review. Take that trolls!

If you are interested in helping add to the guide make sure to checkout the [Contributions](contribute/) section.

I hope you enjoy the website and I can't wait to hear everyone's feedback <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">‚ù§</span>

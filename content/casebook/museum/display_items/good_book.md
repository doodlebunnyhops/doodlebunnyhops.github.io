- The Good Book is first revealed in this quest.
- The quest ends with two unsigned notes, believed to be written by Brave or a group associated with Brave:
  > *"Our forefathers have written upon these scrolls the true meaning of life. It has been my honor in translating these sacred writings into one book that ye may read these words and know the truth."*
  >  
  > *"Beware, for I saith unto you, any other book is meant to mislead you from the truth and keep you in darkness. Look unto thyself for the light is within us all."*

### [Abandoned Mausoleum](/lore/quests/abandoned_mausoleum/)
- The only quest where players can retrieve the Good Book and bring it back to the museum.
- Once placed in the Good Book display case, it reveals hidden words above the Kind and Brave paintings:
  - "Think Alive" appears above Kind’s painting.
  - "Faith Awake" appears above Brave’s painting.
- These messages match a note found in the quest, reinforcing the idea of faith, thought, and awareness as forms of enlightenment.

**Steps:**

1. Go to the hotel - it should look run down (it's from the future)
	1. Click on the book underneath the table
	2. Click on the frame of the empty picture by the door
	3. Click on the button found behind bedside table
		1. Laptop
		
			`The power of The Book will lead you to construct what is needed to destroy our enemy. {Agency}`
		
		2. Bunker Message
		
			`The Book power unveiled [Follow]: [X02](#_666nwxto7jfq) activated`
		
		3. Notice the device on the floor tells us what year we are in _Manufactured in Brookhaven: 2028_
		4. There is a message behind the White Chair on the left side:
		
			`The Book will tell you what to do next, follow its lead and do not think for yourself. In the future as we recruit from the common, be mindful of double agents.`
2. Go to the Agency Base
	1. Behind the Agency Base you should see boxes, use the Hammer on them until they have all disappeared. \*Hit F to type 3 so you hear a hitting sound\*
	2. When completed you will briefly see an orb
		1. Bunker Message: \*note excelerator is misspelled should it be accelerator?\*
		
			`Hydrogen beam excelerator complete: [A16](#_8q1hlllilfnu) activated`

{{< tip "warning" >}}
If you click the Bedside Table Button in the Future Room and get an Error Message on the top right of your screen, the Agency Bunker will show this on the board. There is no way of fixing this but don't worry. It does not affect anything. You can continue the steps as you would normally. It is interesting because it's a completely new message that isn't seen anywhere.

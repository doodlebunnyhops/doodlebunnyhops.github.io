Brookhaven players, get ready—something big is coming! 🚀 Voldex and Wolfpaq have worked together to bring us a brand-new update set to drop this Friday, February 14th. While we don’t have official confirmation of what the update includes, the timing is very suspicious—it lands exactly on Valentine’s Day! Could we be looking at a love-themed update? 💕 We’ll have to wait and see! 

On top of that, I got a huge hint from the devs:
> **A secret has been moved!** 👀  

What exactly does this mean? We don’t know yet! But this confirms secrets and lore are still being taken care of :hearts:. If you’ve been keeping up with the existing secrets, it might be time to retrace your steps after the update!

## **What we know: 💭**

Say hello to **Joylessly**—a Game Producer on the Brookhaven team at Voldex! She reached out to me and others to drop some details about this Friday’s update—and let’s just say, there’s more going on than meets the eye. 👀

Here’s what she confirmed for us:

✔ The update is officially scheduled for **February 14th** ❤️  
✔ A secret has been moved (but not removed—this is important, keep it in mind!) 🔍  
✔ The steps to complete it are still possible and Joylessly made sure of this!  

Now, this raises a very interesting question… If nothing was removed, why move it at all? 🤨 Whatever’s coming this Friday, it’s big enough that something had to shift to make room. 🕵️‍♀️

### **New Swan Vehicle Leaked! 🦢**  
🚨 **LEAK ALERT!** 🚨  

Say hi to **DrakeRose**, a Lead Game Engineer on the Brookhaven team from Voldex!

**DrakeRose**, leaked this image showing a brand-new swan vehicle! It looks like a rideable swan, but could it also be a boat? 🤔 Given that Brookhaven has lakes and surrounded by ocean, it makes sense that this might be a dual-purpose land and water vehicle—but that’s just my theory!  

I’ll be testing this **ASAP** when the update drops, so stay tuned!

## **What might we get? 💝**  

**Could This Be a Valentine’s Update?**  

Let’s think about this—if a secret had to be moved, that has to mean something big is being added, right? 🤔 We don’t have an official changelog yet, but given the date of release, it’s hard not to speculate that this could be a Valentine’s-themed update. If that’s the case, we might see:

💘 Heart-themed decorations around the map, like how we got Easter eggs in past updates  
🚗 Limited-time Valentine vehicles (could the swan be one of them?)  
🏠 New furniture or house updates  
🎁 Special Valentine’s gifts or items

But why move a secret? That makes me think this update isn’t just about aesthetics—something new in the world itself is changing. Could there be a new location? Oh maybe the mall is getting a makeover?! A map expansion? Or maybe even a whole new secret being added?!

Either way, we won’t know for sure until Friday, but I’ll be watching closely for any hints when the update drops!

## **Final thoughts from Daisy 💜**  

This update is shaping up to be an interesting one! With Voldex stepping in and Wolfpaq still involved for a bit, we’re in an era of change for Brookhaven. Whether this means new creative directions, expanded updates, or even fresh takes on secrets and lore, we’ll have to wait and see. Either way, I’ll be keeping a close eye on what’s next!


See y'all **February 14th**!

BloominDaisy 💜

## What did we get??

One of the most anticipated updates each year is the Halloween update from Wolfpaq and boy this one takes it up a notch! As always we got the infamous Candy Corn Hunt. ~~Beware private server owners; Free View Cam has been temporarily disabled just for this event to keep the insane level that much harder!~~

## Secrets

We actually have [confirmation from Wolfpaq](https://discord.com/channels/482308357248647177/870010373976236052/1162421003356483705) that no secrets were added to this update _and_ more is coming regarding the new cave! 
![Wolfpaq messages in discord that no new secrets have been added to this update.](/images/bh/wolf2.jpg)

But what exactly about the cave will be added? Remember the [Construction](/blog/construction) update that brought us a new hidden cave. Lots of players speculated how the lighting in the cave seemed ... _interesting_. and [Wolfpaq confirmed](https://discord.com/channels/482308357248647177/870010373976236052/1162417286792102060) that cave will be apart of Brookhaven Secrets and Mysteries!

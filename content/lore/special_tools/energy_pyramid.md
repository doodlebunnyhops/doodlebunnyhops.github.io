Did you know when viewing home cams, if the church bell has never been rung, looking at the Gold Ranch view will show the bush area next to the barn. When you ring the church bells, it will move the camera for home cams to look at the stables \<- which makes it really easy to see if the Energy Pyramid has spawned there.

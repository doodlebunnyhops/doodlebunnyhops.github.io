Movie Codes can be found throughout Brookhaven on a movie reel. Their locations are **locked** until you turn on a switch in the Agency Bunker, though we don't want to rule out there could be other ways to unlock hidden movie codes.

### How to Find Movie Codes

![Agency Switch Board](/images/bh/agency_switch_board_200.jpg)

1. Go to the Agency Switch Board, also known as [Bunker Switch Board](../../terminology/words#bunker-switch-board) inside of the [Agency Bunker](/map/poi/agency-bunker/).
2. To turn on a switch just click it and it will turn yellow when it's on. Picture above shows each switch is currently off.
3. Each movie code can now be found. Currently there are 3. Click or scroll down to see where to find each movie code.
    - [Police State](#police-station-code)
    - [Abandoned House](#abandoned-house-code)
    - [Eagle View Arch](#eagle-view-arch-code)
    - Example of what a movie code on a reel looks like: ![Eagle View Arch Movie Reel](/images/bh/eagle-view-arch-code-inside.png)
4. Once you have found a movie code, you can play the movie at the mall.
    - Inside the [mall](/map/poi/mall/) to the right is the movie theater.
    - As you're going into the movie theater section, you should see a door on your left, and in that room you can click on the movie projector to put in the code you found.

## Special Lights
You will notice that after watching a movie clip, that some dots on the Agency [Bunker Board ](../../terminology/words#bunker-board)will turn green.

There is one action that is not movie related so it may seem other things can turn these lights on but have yet to be discovered.

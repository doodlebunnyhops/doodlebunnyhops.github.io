>Note you don't need to be present to see all of the crows. So long as you are by the fence between 8:30am - 9am in game you can dig for the green card.

**Steps:**

1. Obtain Green Key Card
	- Look for the crows behind the Barn:
		-  Near the Scarecrow at 7:00am
	- On Top of the Barn at 7:30am
	- On top of the Light Post at 8:00am
	- On the Fence at 8:30am
		-  Dig with a Shovel below the crow on the fence and you will pick up a Green Key Card. May need to move around a bit.
	- These steps are the A15 code, it only lights up on the Agency Bunker panel during a specific time.
2. Message from Laptop: 

	>Use this key wisely, it may open something you are not ready to see. (Mr. B)
3. Swipe card next to Bunker Panel:
	- At Agency Bunker use green key card next to the panel; the light will turn from White to Blue and bunker message will show "Key card accepted"
	- This unlocks the button under the table in the Agency Bunker

Movie Codes can be found throughout Brookhaven on a movie reel. Their locations are locked until you turn on a switch in the Agency Bunker, though we don't want to rule out there could be other ways to unlock hidden movie codes.

### Agency Switch Board

Also known as [Bunker Switch Board](../../terminology/words#bunker-switch-board)

To turn on a switch just click it and it will turn yellow when it's on.

Note that switch **3** is missing... do we need to find it?

In the Aug 25 2023 [Construction update](/blog/construction/) along with a new house plot area called Hidden Valley, thereâ€™s a secret cave just behind the plot!
The BrookhavenRP community went back and forth if it could possibly mean something or was a bug. But on the release of the [Halloween Update](/blog/10-13-23) Wolfpaq gave us some insight.

### Wolfpaq Confirms:


Someone had asked in [Wolfpaq's Discord](https://discord.com/channels/482308357248647177/870010373976236052/1162417286792102060) about a similar image to this one:

Confirming, not only are we going to see a secret update in the future, but this cave will be a part of the Secrets and Mysteries Lore!

### Light Timing 

{{< liteyoutube "nmyaBHSIpPs" >}}

I took a timelapse to see what time the light appears and how it moves, checkout the vid above!

Notice how at one point it looks like a flag, and then morphs into a triangle, as if it's trying to point us to something. What do you think the secret will be?

Light Appears: 9:10am

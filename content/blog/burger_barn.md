### Burger Barn is Back 🍔  
A beloved piece of Brookhaven history has returned! Burger Barn, one of the town’s oldest buildings, makes a triumphant comeback. Originally removed in October 2020, it has been beautifully remodeled to fit Brookhaven’s modern aesthetic while maintaining its charm.

- **Then and Now:** Burger Barn’s original design featured a retro vibe with bold reds and a classic fast-food layout. The updated version boasts sleek black-and-red patterns, modernized seating, and a cozy dining area perfect for role-play or catching up with friends.

#### Comparison:  
| **Old Look (Pre-2020)**                     | **New Look (2024)**                     |

### Say Goodbye...

Happy Burger, the smaller variant inside the mall, has been officially retired to make way for the revamped restaurant. Fans of Happy Burger will recognize its legacy in the updated Burger Barn design.

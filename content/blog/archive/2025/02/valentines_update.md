## **Secrets? 🕵️**  

Secrets shifting around is nothing new in Brookhaven, but it’s always exciting to track them down! Here are the recent shifts from the Mall remodel 🔍  

- [Mystery Alien](/lore/quests/mystery_alien/):
    - The hidden lever is no longer behind the TV station, its now between GIA and EMPIRE clothing stores, still needs a sleeping bag to get in the hidden area.
- [Dove and Energy Pyramid](/casebook/energy_pyramids/): 
    - Dove now appears on the roof top of the mall and Energy Pyramid is still inside Rosie's Gym but in a corner, so much easier to grab now!
- [O1G's Rosie the Cat](/casebook/interesting/special_messages/#memoir-of-rosie-o1gs-cat) has moved to Rosie's Gym :hearts:

I did note that one easter egg was removed 😢

- [Buggstra was here](/casebook/interesting/special_messages/#buggstra-was-here): Is no longer in the mall, I'm continuing to look though perhaps it was reloacted somewhere else entirely.

## **Final thoughts from Daisy 💜**  

Our first update with Voldex is here, and Wolfpaq is still around as the transition continues. I’m thrilled to see the remodel efforts bringing fresh life to the mall—and even happier that secrets are still intact! But now, I have even more to do between grabbing some Japanese food, checking out the new stores, and seeing how Brookhaven continues to grow.

Wishing you all fun adventures, sweet surprises, and maybe even a swan ride! 💘

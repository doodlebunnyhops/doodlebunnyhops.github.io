To all the Brookhaven explorers, puzzle-solvers, and secret-seekers:

After years of sharing stories, walkthroughs, and magical moments, it's time for me to take a step back and focus on personal time.

I know, it's not the blog you were expecting on the recent update...

This decision hasn’t been easy. The community we’ve built together has been one of the most joyful parts of my life online. You've helped each other find hidden buttons, decode riddles, and explore every inch of Brookhaven’s mysteries. I'm endlessly proud of what we've uncovered together.

Part of this decision is simply life—my time and focus are needed elsewhere. As much as I love hunting secrets, my personal journey is calling me to balance other priorities too.

What this means:

- I will no longer be blogging regular update guides.  
- I may still update the site with lore discoveries or major secrets **when time allows**.  
- The site will **remain online** for players around the world to reference and enjoy.  
- I am **not seeking contributors or successors** at this time.

To be clear: this isn’t a statement against Brookhaven or the incredible community that continues to love and build within it. Brookhaven will always hold a special place in my heart.

To the Brookhaven Secrets and Mysteries community—thank you. For the notes you shared, the secrets you chased, and the spirit of collaboration that made this journey unforgettable. This space was always built on your passion as much as mine.

Though I’ll no longer be writing every update, I still love a good mystery. You might find me in-game from time to time, sleuthing for fun or pondering lore in quiet curiosity.

If you’re a young fan reading this: thank you for your imagination. Stay safe, ask big questions, and never stop exploring with kindness. You are the reason I created this site in the first place.

With love and a grateful heart,  
**Daisy**

## Linked Electric & Water

{{< tip >}}
Refer to Quest: [Electric Building](/lore/quests/#electric-building) to access the building.
{{< /tip >}}

### Notes
- Electricity Building and Water Pipes in Town Hall, and Camera at Madison Lake are linked
    - When water levers 2-4 are turned on, the brookhaven electric room still reads “Mainframe unavailable”
    - Once the camera on the mountain near Lake Madison is clicked and Danger is turned on - then it reads “Coolers running at 54% capacity” in Brookhaven Electric
        - This triggers the carbon blocks to spawn from [Destroy Carbon Blocks](/lore/quests/#destroy-carbon-blocks) quest
    - With the above done if you flip on one more water lever, doesn't matter which, then Electricity Building reads "Power Diverted"
        - Power Diverted message when [Monoliths](/lore/quests/#monoliths) are spawning will trigger [Mysterious Steam](/casebook/quantum/steam/) in the quantum room.

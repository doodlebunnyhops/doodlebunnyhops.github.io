Energy Pyramids can be found all throughout Brookhaven after triggering them to spawn. 
It's considered a [special tool](/lore/special_tools/energy_pyramid) since it's not available in inventory and can only be obtained after ringing the church bell and then looking for it in one of many locations.

Always a pair of doves will call near the energy pyramid to help guide you to the energy crystal's location.

### Mechanics

**How many church bell rings?**

While there's been debate on how many times to ring the church bell, 1 ring will summon the doves and energy pyramid. Though it's common for 3 rings, and it seems to be ok to do more than this back to back.


**How long do Doves and Energy Pyramids Stay?**

The doves and energy pyramid will spawn at the same time together, but the pyramid will disappear about 18-20 minutes in game after they spawned and the doves about 10 minutes in game after that.


**Is there a pattern to spawning?**

So far I haven't identified any pattern. Though some locations seem to get the dove and energy crystal more than others, but this might be because that's where I tend to hangout most on the map. My only real observation is noticing the energy pyramid location near Gold Ranch doesn't seem to spawn at night time, but I haven't fully tested this yet.

### Known Locations

I have personally set out to test secrets and findings. These are locations I've seen first hand.

1. **Spawn**: Doves are on the swing with the Energy Pyramid on the tree next to the Police Station 
2. **Motel**: Doves spwan just above Motel Lobby sitting on railing, and pyramid on a perch to the right of the doves.
3. **Rosie's Gym**: Doves appear on the roof of the mall and the Energy Pyramid in a corner of Rosie's Gym in the Mall upstairs.
4. **Town Hall**: Doves are on the upstairs balcony of Town Hall. The Energy Pyramid spawns on the ground next to the tree between Town Hall and the Fire Station.
5. **Horse Stables**: perched on fence and the Energy Pyramid spawns by hay (teleport by going to Gold Ranch for faster travels!) 
6. **Cabin**: Doves spawn on the top of the Cabin Roof and the Energy Pyramid spawns behind a tree near a big Gray Rock on the left side of the cabin

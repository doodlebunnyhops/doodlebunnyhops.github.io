Lock your doors! You can now rob the Grocery Store, Food Mart, and the Bank Armored Vehicle. But will criminals run rampant?

## Recap

Ok so ... being a little bad can be fun the RP world to give the story line something extra for sure. Gun models came with extra customization's including flashlight and zoom in with scoped rifles!

But do not fear good citizens of Brookhaven, there's a new Police Station alarm when robberies are reported! Phew!

## Secrets

Maybe? There certainly seems to be hint and nothing found as of yet from the time writing this... so what did we find?

On the side of the new Armored Bank Vehicle you can change the theme... into an Agency Armored Vehicle <span class="emojify">ü§î</span> ... interesting


But look closer, we see an [Agency Light Panel](../../casebook/light_panel/) number **X22** which is still an unknown how to activate.

There are _so many_ X lights that we don't know, I haven't even included them in the Agency Light Panel list. There's 24 X lights and we've only found how to activate X01 and X02 <span class="emojify">üòµ‚Äç</span>

Is this a hint we should try to find what activates it?

Hope everyone enjoys the new additions as much as I will! Till next time

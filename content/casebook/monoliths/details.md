### Agency Bunker Message Board inside

Immediately after completing A18 the message board reads

`“Carbon ingot articulating Arch forcefield :NO ERRORS :A18”`

If you wait ~13 to 14 hours in game, and I mean do nothing, monoliths will stop appearing and bunker message will update with: 

`“Arch forcefield center mass taken offline: Continue with caution! :A18”`

A18 will shut off once this message has appeared.

When I tested this it was the first quest I did on a fresh server, then sat in front of the agency bunker message till it changed. Once I started doing other secret quests, a18 was no longer lit up. 
The second test I did this quest first and then worked on other quests thinking the monolith message would change after the 13/14 hr mark. It did not

### Quantum Steam + Monoliths

See [Mysterious Steam](/casebook/quantum/steam/) for more details

It’s been observed that Monolith's spawning pattern matches when Quantum Steam occurs.

When the Quantum room begins to steam it means a monolith has despawned. 
Once the steam stops, a new Monolith location will appear on both Message Boards.
The monolith will remain there until the steam appears again.

### Agency Bunker Message Board outside

Notice just outside of the Agency Bunker a new Message Board appears
Message outside of Agency Bunker on the wall is always prepended with `***()***`. 

Example:

`..()..()..()..()()..***()***`

### Future Motel Message Board

Also found Monolith Scripture behind the motel wall, prepended with `<^^>`

Example:

`..()..()..()..()()..<^^>`

Motel must be in the future state and will show behind the room that was first spawned into the future.

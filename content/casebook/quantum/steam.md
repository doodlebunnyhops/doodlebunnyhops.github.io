You can cause steam to happen in one of the 4 rooms in the Quantum Room. 

But what does the steam mean, and why does it only happen when Monoliths appear?

### Related To Monoliths

{{< tip >}}
Right after the steam stops and the floor flashes black, this means a new Monolith has spawned!
{{< /tip >}}

Checkout locations of [Monoliths](/lore/quests#monoliths).

{{< tab "Monolith" >}}
When a Monolith Despawns, this is when steam starts in the quantum room.

{{< tab "Steam" >}}
Why do Monoliths cause steam in here? Is it because of energy building up to create another monolith?

{{< tab "Floor Flashes" >}}
Once a new monolith has spawned, the floor where steam once was will flash black.

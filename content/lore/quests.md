Sometimes tools, special tools, or other quests are required to complete a quest and will be listed in the `requirements` section.

Notes and messages found along the way are in our [CaseBook](casebook/) for safe keeping.

By digging a hole, you can uncover the dirt that was displaced or removed from its original location, leaving a hole in the ground. Therefore, seeking the bottom of a hill leads you to a hole where you can find the dirt that was once there.

1. Place money in hand, as the note from Marcus suggested, and go through the lasers.
	
	You are now in the Agency's Lair
1. There is a hidden spot to click on the desk in this green room. It’s part of the desk panel underneath.
	
	![Button under desk](/images/bh/agency_greed_desk_2_button.jpg)

	This will reveal the Agency logo behind the desk and the words “Greed & Fear” behind one of the maps

1. *OPTIONAL* If you have connected your laptop: After sitting in the chairs, open your laptop to see a new message from the Agency. *We still need confirmation if all chairs or just one need to be sat in.

	`Follow blindly, do not think. Money is everything!. (Agency)`

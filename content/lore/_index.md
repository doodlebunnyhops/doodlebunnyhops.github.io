### What is the Lore of Brookhaven RP?

We started out with a few hints around the Town of Brookhaven. A movie clip, some notes, a strange experimentation room above the hospital. But what does it all mean?

We're on a mystery hunt to find clues and solve the mystery of Brookhaven!

### Where to get started

If  you're new to Secrets and Mysteries of Brookhaven, it's suggested starting out getting the [Connected Laptop](/lore/tools/connect_laptop) in the [Tools](/lore/tools) section and then following the [Quests](/lore/quests/). They are laid out in a way here to keep from jumping around too much, but they don't have to be done in any particular order.

If you're pretty familiar or want to look at a specific thing, each tool, special tool, and quest will list requirements they have so you can easily decide where you would like to start!

Keep in mind, maybe there are steps we shouldn't do, though commonly the community feels all steps and lights in the [Agency Light Panel](../../casebook/light_panel/) should be done to solve the mystery.

### Why are some things a quest, and others not?

The flow of investigating can be... chaotic. But I have identified there are tools, special tools, and quests to help guide you through your journey on what has been discovered.



{{% button href="./tools/" style="green" %}}Tools{{% /button %}}: These are items that give us hints along the way of our investigation.

{{% button href="./special_tools/" style="green" %}}Special Tools{{% /button %}}: These are items not available in inventory and are needed for other quests.

{{% button href="./quests/" style="green" %}}Quests{{% /button %}}: These are considered main story line quests, they may unlock, build, or show us new hints. Since this is an ever updating game, we don't know if a quest is ever really complete.

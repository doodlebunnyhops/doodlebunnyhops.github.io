Alright robbers, it's time to plan the ultimate heist! We got gold, diamonds, and bitcoin to get our greedy hands on!

## What did we get in Brookhaven??

The bank has expanded with a vault system underneath through the restricted area... where it's just _asking_ to be taken.

Once you get in the vaulted area, make sure to grab some supplies :wink:.

There are 3 spots to loot, each with its own challenges... will you make it out before the police get to you?

First get a key behind glass to open the gate to the right in this picture. Then you will come up to a glass door...break the buttons on the wall to short circuit it! And voila now use that explosion again :bomb: </p>

## Secrets

Nothing found from in this update, _but_ `@lorenzomaciotti` from WolfPaq's discord found a [4th Top Secret Level plaque](casebook/interesting/top_secret_level/#ts-lvl4) that went unnoticed in the Agency RP Release!

I've added a section just on [TS LVL's](casebook/interesting/top_secret_level/) in the casebook :D enjoy!

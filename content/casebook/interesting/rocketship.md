Unclear if this has anything to do with the Brookhaven Mystery, but it is a Fun Find for RP.

Requirements: None
Steps:

Energy Source:
Head inside of the Rocketship and go up the elevator, then into the Control Room that has a big screen with the captain's chair facing it.
Jump on top of the Arch above the entrance door. Once you are there, jump again, you should go through a hidden floor that reveals a ladder. Go up the ladder.
You should now see a blue Glowing Orb, suspected of being the ship's Energy Source.

Alien’s Present Aboard:
In the Control Room on the ship, clicking on “hall breach” will now show mysterious Alien Hand Prints throughout the ship.
Locations: 
Cryo/Medical room: One of the capsules and on the floor near the ladders leading down to the kitchen.
Bathroom: On the floor near the ladder leading to Cyro/Medical Room, and inside of the Toilet Room
Kitchen: on the Digital Menu Board
Oxygen/Fuel Room: Near the door by Fuel Tank and appears that the button has been destroyed
Afterburner: Go down the ladder in the Oxygen/Fuel Room and you will see the handprint on the bottom of the ladder.

Admin Kate has been a monumental help in wolfpaq's Secrets and Mysteries channel in his discord. She has given lots of hints and nudges along our journey. 

Lets also give thanks to Kate, ~as she is away for a little bit~ and hope she is doing alright :heart:

Big Welcome back message for Kate! We're so happy to see you again :heart:

## Message to KreekCraft


Back in 2022, Kate sent a few notes of interest to Kreek on the power lines that lead from the portal to the Abandoned house - perhaps suggesting the Abandoned House is powered through those lines? 

It was also observed by a Wolfpack secrets and mystery community member that there was a room and perhaps this is real but has still yet to be discovered!

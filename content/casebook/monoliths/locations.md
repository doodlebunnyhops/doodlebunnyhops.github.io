Every 1 hour - 4 hours in game time a monolith will spawn somewhere in Brookhaven with Similar Odd code.

We learned that the Monolith Message Boards found outside of the Agency Bunker and behind the Future Motel Room lead us to the Monolith's location.

Please see the [Monolith Map](/map/monoliths/) for all locations and pictures of each.

## Safe Location in Hacker RP House

This is just really hard to explain! There are so many entry points into the maze that gets you to the safe, but lets watch a video :D

## Secrets

While no secrets related to the Lore of Brookhaven, this new Roleplay set offers so many of it's own secrets with all the hidden places you can get into! I honestly lost count with all the false walls! There's a hidden red room, you can get into the area under the elevator entrance, and while in that void area there are a couple more false walls to hidden rooms! Where does it end haha! 

Have fun everyone!

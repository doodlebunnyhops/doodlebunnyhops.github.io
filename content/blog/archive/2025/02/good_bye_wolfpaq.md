Today, Brookhaven players woke up to some **huge** news—after 4.5+ years of developing Brookhaven, **Wolfpaq has officially handed over the game to [Voldex](https://voldex.com/news/voldex-acquires-brookhaven-the-most-visited-game-on-roblox/)**. This marks the end of an era, but also the **start of a new chapter** for the game we all love. 💙

## **What Does This Mean for Brookhaven?** 🤔  
Wolfpaq has been the **sole developer** of Brookhaven since its launch, crafting every update, mystery, and feature. Now, Voldex—a studio known for running and expanding Roblox experiences—will take the reins.  


Wolfpaq assured players that he’ll be **working alongside Voldex for a few months** to help transition and make sure updates go smoothly. This means we **can still expect Brookhaven to grow**, just under a new team. 🚀  


Voldex has officially confirmed the news, sharing their excitement to continue Brookhaven’s journey while preserving what makes it special. You can read their statement here: [Voldex Acquires Brookhaven](https://voldex.com/news/voldex-acquires-brookhaven-the-most-visited-game-on-roblox/)  


## **Was This Change Teased in the Game?** 👀  
Looking back, the **[Abandoned RP Set update](/blog/abandoned_house_rp_secrets/)** now seems like it was a **subtle hint** at this transition.

Now, knowing what we do, it’s hard **not** to see the connection. Was this Wolfpaq’s way of preparing us for the change? 🤯  

## **A Community United in Gratitude** 💜  
Brookhaven’s **secrets and mysteries** have always been at the heart of the game in my eyes, bringing players together in thrilling discoveries. In Wolfpaq’s **[Secrets & Mysteries](https://discord.com/channels/482308357248647177/870010373976236052/1336358926849015828)** channel, players have come together to share their appreciation for everything he’s built. 🔍 From unraveling cryptic puzzles to uncovering hidden lore, the community has thrived under his creativity, and today, that same love and admiration shines as players express their gratitude for his dedication. 🏆  

Thank you Wolfpaq for reaching out to the Mystery Community, we love you too! :hearts:

## **Final Thoughts from Daisy** 🌸  
Brookhaven has been more than just a game—it has been a world filled with secrets, stories, and shared adventures. Wolfpaq’s dedication shaped this experience, and I am ever grateful for the time, energy, and passion he poured into every update. While this chapter closes, I have faith that he will guide the transition so that the magic of Brookhaven’s secrets will **continue to live on**. 

I'm glad you're taking time for you and your family :heart: 

✨ Thank you, Wolfpaq, for everything. 💜

Forever in our hearts,

**BloominDaisy 💜**

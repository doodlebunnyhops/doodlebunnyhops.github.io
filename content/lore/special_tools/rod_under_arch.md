There's a white bent rod hidden, what does it do?

{{< youtube id=Fi7kt9ZhQ2Y loading=lazy >}}

>**Requirements** : None

**Steps:**

1. Spawn the Bakery House and go inside
	1. There is a button underneath one of the beds on the Second Floor, click on it
1. Ring the bell at the Church: Activates [A22](../../casebook/light_panel#a22)
	1. In the Bakery House: where the vault room is, there should be a note now. If you can see the note, now you can find the rod.
1. Go to the Arch by the Barn, and look underneath it, side by the Barn (notice it's lifted a little) click it: Activates [H07](../../casebook/light_panel#h07)

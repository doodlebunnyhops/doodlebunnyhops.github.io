**Steps:**

1. Go to building above Mail & Packages
	1. If it's not already converted, change the room to "Museum"
	1. With the Red Book in hand, approach the display that looks like a stand - it will glow red!
	1. You will see a ghost and the text appear below the pictures by the ghost
 "Greed" and "Fear"
	1. Once you have activated the Ghostly Sighting - head to the grave yard
		1. Notice the grave that says "Let me out". If someone changed the headstone it's the one that you can fall into.
			The back now says "Creator of Agency"

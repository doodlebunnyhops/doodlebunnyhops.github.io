### Secret Relocations 🔍

The motel update also brings changes to Brookhaven’s iconic secrets! Some secret items have been moved to fit the remodel:

- **Dove** 🕊️: Now perched on the upstairs railing above the lobby.
- **Energy Pyramid** :sparkles:: Found on a ledge just to the right of the dove.
- **Monolith Sign** 🪧: Relocated to the **back wall of the motel**, making it easier to spot without needing to access a hidden wall.

#### Some notable findings..

- You can now load the normal state of the "run down" hotel room by holding [the red book](/lore/special_tools/the_red_book/) in your hand when you select that theme.
    - Unsure if this is a bug, but I don't personally think it is.
- There are _lots_ of new hiding places ;) see if you can find them
    - :eyes: Like getting under the pool ... hehehe
- The enfamous [red book stand in the museum](/lore/quests/ghostly_sighting/) makes an apperance in one of the themes!

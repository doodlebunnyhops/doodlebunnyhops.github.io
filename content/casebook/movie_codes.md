Movie Codes can be found throughout Brookhaven on a movie reel. Their locations are **locked** until you turn on a switch in the Agency Bunker, though we don't want to rule out there could be other ways to unlock hidden movie codes.

## How to Find Movie Codes

![Agency Switch Board](/images/bh/agency_switch_board_200.jpg)
{{% notice style="red" %}}
Note that switch **3** is missing... do we need to find it?
{{% /notice %}}

**Steps:**

1. Unlock hidden Movie Codes.
    1. Go to the Agency Switch Board, also known as [Bunker Switch Board](../../terminology#bunker-switch-board) inside of the [Agency Bunker](/map/poi/agency-bunker/).
    2. To turn on a switch just click it and it will turn yellow when it's on. Picture above shows each switch is currently off.
1. Each _hidden_ movie code can now be found. Currently there are 3 hidden by the switch, and 1 that is always visible. Click or scroll down to see where to find each movie code.
    - [Police State](#police-station-code): Hidden by Switch 2
    - [Abandoned House](#abandoned-house-code): Hidden by Switch 4
    - [Eagle View Arch](#eagle-view-arch-code): Hidden by Switch 1
    - [Movie Theater](#movie-theater-code): Always Visible

### Historical Location

Before the  [School, Hospital, Police Station Remodle Update](/blog/school_hospital_police_station_remodel) on November 29, 2024; the movie reel in the police station actually required you to go up a ladder to get to it's hidden location.

While this no longer exists, here's what this step used to look like.

## How to use a Movie Code


1. Once you have found a movie code, you can play the movie at the mall.
    - Inside the [mall](/map/poi/mall/) to the right is the movie theater.
    - As you're going into the movie theater section, you should see a door on your left, and in that room you can click on the movie projector to put in the code you found.



{{< tabs title="Click Tab ->" >}}

{{% tab title="Click on Movie Projector" %}}
Type in the code then press enter

## Special Lights
You will notice that after watching a movie clip, that some dots on the Agency [Bunker Board ](../../terminology#bunker-board)will turn green.

There is one action that is not movie related so it may seem other things can turn these lights on but have yet to be discovered.

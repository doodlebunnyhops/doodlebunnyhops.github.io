Something strange is going on at the Power Plant.  

The question isn’t just what’s hidden inside… but whether you’ll be the one to prevent the meltdown or make it happen.  

Either way, the reward is waiting: the Green Crystal and a new Agency panel unlock.  

If you’re here for the full breakdown of steps, don’t worry....I’ve got you covered!

### A Personal Note 💛

I don’t blog every update anymore, stepping back has given me more time with friends and family. But I’ll keep posting secrets when I can.  

The newest discoveries are here, and I hope you enjoy them. And the friendships that come with the hunt as it did for me :heart:

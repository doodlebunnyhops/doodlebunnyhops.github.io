These docs consists of two parts:

1. Tools: Handy items used to get started with
1. Quests: Steps and progression to solving the mystery!

Please note that the features listed under each theme are independent of each other. That is to say, some features may only be found in one theme and not in both.

<!-- That content is better than dummy lorem ipsum 2) That content serves a good real-world demo for this theme 3) Publish more structured docs for each theme which are better than long blocky READMEs -->

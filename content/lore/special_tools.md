## Energy Pyramid
An interesting glowing pyramid object believed to have energy within it.

{{< youtube "Od4GhfXB-bU" >}}

>**Requirements** : None

{{< tip >}}
Did you know when viewing home cams, if the church bell has never been rung, looking at the Gold Ranch view will show the bush area next to the barn. When you ring the church bells, it will move the camera for home cams to look at the stables \<- which makes it really easy to see if the Energy Pyramid has spawned there.
{{< /tip >}}

<h3>Steps:</h3>

<h4>Summon Doves:</h4>

1. Ring the bell at the Church (Teleport by going to house #22 or #17 to get to the church quickly)
  1. Bunker Message will now read: "Enemy signal Detected: A22"
  2. This wakes up the doves - now look in one of these locations for the Energy Pyramid

<h4>Known locations doves appear at:</h4>

1. **Spawn**: Doves are on the swing with the Energy Pyramid on the tree next to the Police Station 
2. **Hotel**: Spawns in the Storage Closet in the office. 
3. **Rosie's Gym**: Spawns inside of the Mall behind the TV in Rosie's Gym upstairs.
4. **Town Hall**: Doves are on the upstairs balcony of Town Hall. The Energy Pyramid spawns on the ground next to the tree between Town Hall and the Fire Station.
5. **Horse Stables**: perched on fence and the Energy Pyramid spawns by hay (teleport by going to Gold Ranch for faster travels!) 
6. **Cabin**: Doves spawn on the top of the Cabin Roof and the Energy Pyramid spawns behind a tree near a big Gray Rock on the left side of the cabin 


>**Laptop Message** After the Energy Pyramid is obtained:
>_The crystal will help you see through deception. (Mr. B)_

## Green Key Card

The green card does _something_...

{{< youtube "47yimxPrOvE" >}}



{{< tip >}}
**Requirements** : None

**Items Needed** : Shovel
{{< /tip >}}

>Note you don't need to be present to see all of the crows. So long as you are by the fence between 8:30am - 9am in game you can dig for the green card.

**Steps:**

1. Obtain Green Key Card
	- Look for the crows behind the Barn:
		-  Near the Scarecrow at 7:00am
		- On Top of the Barn at 7:30am
		- On top of the Light Post at 8:00am
		- On the Fence behind the barn on the far left at 8:30am
			-  Dig with a Shovel below the crow on the fence and you will pick up a Green Key Card. May need to move around a bit.
	- These steps are the A15 code, it only lights up on the Agency Bunker panel during a specific time.
2. Message from Laptop: 

	`Use this key wisely, it may open something you are not ready to see. (Mr. B)`
3. Swipe card next to Bunker Panel:
	- At Agency Bunker use green key card next to the panel; the light will turn from White to Blue and bunker message will show `Key card accepted`
	- This unlocks the button under the table in the Agency Bunker.
		- The button doesn't seem to do anything _yet_.

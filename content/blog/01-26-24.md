Apparently more props wasn't enough! But not to worry, navigating all these props just got easier!

## What did we get??

70, yes **70** more props have been added! It's getting harder to remember which ones are new üòÖ


Quality of Life update to Props navigation. Now finding the props you want just got even easier! No more switching between props with the hand icon!

Lets checkout the props with Darzeth!

## Secrets

It's likely no secrets will be in the white house, as Wolfpaq hasn't ever put lore inside locked content before. 

No reports have been made regarding the the Schools new features... but I have a sneaky suspicion where something might come in the future... looking at you western theme...

Have fun everyone!

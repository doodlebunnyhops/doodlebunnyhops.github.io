The Agency is trying to summon something or someone using the power of a purple orb and your cleverness to help them...

### What did we get in Brookhaven??

The **entire** update is _all secrets_ and _lore_! There's so much that I'm just going to kick you to the walk through where I have recommended youtube clips and pics to help you on your journey!

This was super exciting and _maybe_ a heads up - if  you spook easily :wink: you've been warned.

There are spiders, and either a spirit or some other entity that likes to watch you all while you are running around a dungeon - which occasionally losses power...Take a flashlight!

### Who Solved it?

A lot of people came together! Which makes it really hard to know who solved what, but I still have a handful of folks I'd like to call out that I hung out with :heart:. For me these are the people that solved it with me, I was in direct chat with them and we were cheering on when we found a part and silently kicking buckets when we got stuck.

### Ending Thoughts

It's updates like this that make me so proud to be apart of a lore community. Of course I love a good solve, but playing with others putting our minds together. LOVE IT.

Now that the dust has settled on finding all the little secrets, the convos are alive again as new theories emerge.

_Dear Wolfpaq,_

_Thank you for this amazing group. Look at how you brought us together!_

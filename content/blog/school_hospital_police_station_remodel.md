### St. Luke‚Äôs Hospital Remodel :hospital:

The hospital received an aesthetic upgrade, featuring a sleek, glass-heavy exterior and a brighter, modernized look. While the layout remains the same, the polished design and improved lighting give it a fresh feel. Secret hunters should note that the crystal on the roof for the "Find 7 Crystals" quest has moved closer to the center of the roof, making it easier to locate.

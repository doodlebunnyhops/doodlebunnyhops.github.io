Welcome to ye Castle! Behold my thrown! But be wary as a Knight has hidden something within these walls!..

### Deets

That's right... _we have SECRETS_! And it was a doozy to find for the Wolfpaq discord community. But lets _quickly_ see what's new!

A new Castle RP Set that includes Horse Jousting, Sword, Area, Training Area and a Dungeon

Tool Inventory has added a Sword, and Bow and Arrow


Creator Cam and Private Server Controls has been moved into the Settings located on bottom left of the screen. _Reason: Due to upcoming Rolbox UI Changes_

_Yes_ there is a safe to be found in the castle, but I think you'll find that's the easiest of things hiding in this medieval place.

Here are some great youtube creators show casing the update :D

## Secrets

So lets get into it... because it was _CRAZY_ in Wolfpaq's Discord. Lots of running around, lots of confusion... _Wolfpaq giving hints!_ But so, so much fun!

In all there are 3 new notes hidden in the castle, you can checkout the **[walkthrough here](/lore/quests/knight_of_the_castle)**. I've added a new section in the [Casebook](/casebook/museum/), it _seems_ each of the paintings in Brookhaven Museum might have some secrets they're holding. 

But the crazier part about all of this, despite the assist from Wolfpaq <span class="emojify">ðŸ’•</span>

We got _another_ confirmation that secrets are coming.. and not just for [Hidden Valley Cave](/casebook/interesting/hidden_valley_cave/#wolfpaq-confirms)...

![Wolfpaq confirms in Discord that the 2nd book will be coming in another update](/images/bh/wolf_confirm_2nd_book.jpg)

**_YES_** There will be another book and secret update! Based on the notes in the castle, maybe this book will be opposite from [The Red Book](/lore/special_tools/the_red_book)!  <span class="emojify">ðŸ¤¯</span>

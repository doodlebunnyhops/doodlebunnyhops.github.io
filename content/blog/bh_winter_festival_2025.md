The Brookhaven Winter Festival is here, bringing festive cheer and a few surprises for secret hunters!

### ❄️ Winter Festival Has Moved Some Secrets!

The festival decorations have reshuffled a few familiar locations. Here's what's changed:

{{< column "grid-2 post-block" >}}

{{< column "post-block-dot column" >}}
**Agency Bunker Entrance** 
Still in the same spot, just in a little nook..which also makes a great hiding spot for snowball fights!

{{< /column>}}

{{< column "post-block-dot column" >}}
**Eagle View Plot** 
 Moved behind the festival to make room for activities, along with the mall and gas station.

{{< column "post-block-dot column" >}}
**Portal under Eagle View** 
Is still there - but note the water affect is temporarily removed.

{{< column "post-block-dot column" >}}
**Hidden Movie Reel** 
 No longer under the arch! It's now hidden on Eagle View's hill.

{{< column "post-block-dot column" >}}
**Monolith** 
The one that spawned by Eagle View has relocated to the underpass near the abandoned house.

**Monolith** 
Bridge Underpass by Abandoned House is now ontop of the Festival Mountain. _Thank you bright_leaa_

These changes are expected to be temporary while the Winter Festival runs, but there's a chance the Brookhaven devs might make some relocations permanent to better accommodate both events and secret hunters in the future.

### A Personal Note 💛

This year reminded me why I started sharing secrets in the first place — not just for the discoveries, but for the people who find them together.

I may post less, but my curiosity hasn’t gone anywhere. I’ll keep popping in when something special is uncovered, and I’m grateful for everyone who’s made the hunt feel like home.

Here’s to quiet discoveries, shared wonder, and whatever secrets the next year brings.

Better together, one discovery at a time

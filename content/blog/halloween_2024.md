It’s back, Brookhaven! 🎃 The Annual Halloween Candy Corn Hunt is here once again, and while it’s mostly the same as last year, it’s still as fun as ever. Time to track down those hidden candies and score some sweet, limited-time Halloween rewards! If you're a **VIP Pass** holder, you'll also have access to all the vehicles from last year's event!

## What’s New This Year?

Not much has changed for this Halloween event, so for all you returning hunters, you know what to expect! The difficulty levels range from:

- **New Vehicles**: All vehicles unlocked from the candy corn hunt are brand new, except for the **Easy Mode** vehicle, which has been updated to feature candy corn pieces on it. So, even if you completed Easy Mode last year, you'll want to grab this revamped ride!
- **Difficulty Levels**: The hunt still features **Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme,** and **Insane** modes. As always, Easy, Medium, and Hard keep you in the central part of town, while Extreme and Insane take you on a tougher search around the edges of Brookhaven, with ladders needed to reach those tricky spots!


Like last year, you can pick your difficulty at the Halloween sign near **spawn** and the **police station**. Successfully completing each level unlocks a **Halloween-themed vehicle** for the duration of the event, so don’t miss out on collecting them!

## New Home – The Horse House 🏡🐴

While the candy hunt remains the same, there’s something fresh in this update—a brand new **Horse House**! This ranch-style home features a horse stable, a **horse wash station**, and even a **trophy case**. Perfect for those of you looking to show off your horse-riding skills in Brookhaven.

- **Secret Safe Location**: Want to steal from the house’s hidden safe? You’ll have to find it first! This time, it’s hidden underground with access from the horse stable. Look for it behind some boxes and use a ladder to get to it!

## Secrets üïµÔ∏èüîç

Both Artist‚Äôs Apartment and Artist‚Äôs Penthouse contain hidden vaults! The method to access them is the same in both homes. To uncover the vault, you will need to use a sleeping bag against the back wall of the bedroom‚Äîthis will allow you to glitch through and enter the secret space.

As for lore discoveries‚Äînothing new has been found yet. Though I must say the one painting in props looks eerily similar to either Mr. Brookhaven or his brother Greed..üëÄ

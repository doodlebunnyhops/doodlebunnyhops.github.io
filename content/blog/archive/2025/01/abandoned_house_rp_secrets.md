## Final Thoughts from Daisy 💜  

One of the most heartwarming parts of this adventure has been watching Wolfpaq’s Secrets and Mysteries community come together in his [Discord](https://discord.gg/wolfpaqgames) to solve the Mausoleum’s secrets as a team. Even though I was away for a portion of it, seeing everyone’s excitement and collaboration reminded me why this community is so special. If you’re not part of it yet, don’t worry :hearts: [Wolfpaq’s Discord](https://discord.gg/wolfpaqgames) is a public space, and you can always join in on the fun!

A huge thank you to Wolfpaq and his team for giving us this incredible adventure. This update feels particularly special, and the Easter egg message, “Forever grateful - Wolfpaq,” tucked away in the Mausoleum, speaks volumes about the passion and care that went into it.

Looking back at my [New Year’s blog](/blog/happy_new_year_2025/), I had a feeling the Good Book would finally make its appearance in 2025. Seeing it tied to the Mausoleum’s mysteries—and remembering the song I wrote about it, [Beneath the Moonlit Skies](/blog/happy_new_year_2025/#a-song-for-the-year-) — makes this moment feel extra meaningful.

### What is the Lore of Brookhaven RP?

We started out with a few hints around the Town of Brookhaven. A movie clip, some notes, a strange experimentation room above the hospital. But what does it all mean?

We're on a mystery hunt to find clues and solve the mystery of Brookhaven!

### Where to get started

It's recommended starting with the Tools section and then move along to Quests, as special tools will be done as needed with a quest.

There are times the guide may have you jump around due to requirements, it's proper to use your back button when you're done with a requirement task to get back to your quest.

Keep in mind, maybe there are steps we shouldn't do, though commonly the community feels all steps and lights in the [Agency Light Panel](../../casebook/light_panel) should be done to solve the mystery.

### Why are some things a quest, and others not?

The flow of investigating can be... chaotic. But I have identified there are tools, special tools, and quests to help guide you through your journey on what has been discovered.



**Tools**: These are items that give us hints along the way of our investigation.

**Special Tools**: These are items not available in inventory and are needed for other quests.

**Quests**: These are considered main story line quests, they may unlock, build, or show us new hints. Since this is an ever updating game, we don't know if a quest is ever really complete.

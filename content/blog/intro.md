## Introduction

Hey it's BloominDaisy here! A local at the Secrets and Mysteries discord channel in Wolfpaq's server.

I worked on this site after seeing a lot of consistent use of the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xIEoVSAsFoBpZYfg6fYfoWsWe6F7Pu-ARkPTVMRCTZk/edit?usp=sharing) I had started back in January of this year.

### Why the Change

With the doc's growth and more players wanting to help contribute I had to come up with a way to solve 2 problems.

{{< tip >}}
Make the experience of using the guide easier, for experienced investigators and new ones alike.
{{< /tip >}}

{{< tip >}}
Provide a way for contributions to be _safely_ added.
	
Trolls make this hard... 
{{< /tip >}}

**And I found a way!**

### Solution

I'm hosting this website through github.com, which really makes it easy to have players submit a ticket to contribute to the site only after review. Take that trolls!

If you are interested in helping add to the guide make sure to checkout the [Contributions](../../contribute) section.

### What happens to the OG doc?

<span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">üòä</span> It's not going anywhere, I recognize it's been the go to for a little while for a lot of players and it's also where I keep my list of to do's. It'll continue to be updated, along with the website, as secrets are found <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">üòÅ</span>


I hope you enjoy the website and I can't wait to hear everyone's feedback <span class="nowrap"><span class="emojify">‚ù§</span>

**Steps:**

1. Spawn in the Plant House
2. In the Basement Area - click on the Green Plant Book
	1. Activates [H06](/casebook/light_panel#h06)
	1. Bunker Message:
 
		==Plant Quantum Saved: [H06]==
		
3. Quantum Room has new message on one of the "windows":

	==Seek the bottom of a hill to find the dirt that once was filled==

	1. Hint is likely telling us to "Go to a graveyard".

		>When you seek the bottom of a hill, you are descending to lower ground. The "dirt that once was filled" refers to the soil that was once in the spot where the hole is now. By digging a hole, you can uncover the dirt that was displaced or removed from its original location, leaving a hole in the ground. Therefore, seeking the bottom of a hill leads you to a hole where you can find the dirt that was once there.

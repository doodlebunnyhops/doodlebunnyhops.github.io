<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 1</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Time</h3>

The room felt smaller than usual, its simple stone walls pressing in on William as he rummaged through his belongings. The chest at the foot of his bed creaked as he lifted its lid, brushing his hands over the worn fabric of his tunics. One by one, he folded them into his pack with mechanical precision, though his thoughts were far from orderly.

The trial of fears—a test every royal must face to earn a place among the Knights Guardians—was just days away. Success meant honor, a legacy etched alongside his ancestors. Failure meant disgrace. The thought coiled tighter around his chest with every passing moment.

He had heard the stories since he was a child, tales of how the trial stripped away pretenses and left only the core of who you truly were. It wasn’t just a test—it was a reckoning. Those who faltered bore the shame of it for generations. His hands stilled over the half-packed bag, the weight of its purpose pressing down on him like a stone.

What if I fail?

The faint scuff of boots at the door snapped him from his spiraling thoughts. He looked up, startled, to find Matthew leaning casually against the frame, his arms crossed, his grin maddeningly familiar.

“You won’t need half of that, Will,” came a voice from the doorway, light and teasing.

William glanced up sharply, his tension immediately prickling into irritation. Leaning casually against the frame, arms crossed and a smug grin firmly in place, was Matthew. His twin brother—older by minutes, if either of them could ever get the truth out of their parents—carried the same sharp features as William, but that was where the similarities ended. Where William’s dark hair always seemed to lie slightly out of place, Matthew’s fell perfectly, as though styled by some unseen hand. His posture, his confidence—it all seemed effortless. It always had.

William blinked, his grip tightening on the garment before he set it down with exaggerated care. “And you’re so sure, why?”

Matthew pushed off the frame and sauntered into the room, his every movement annoyingly effortless. “Just looking out for you, brother. I’ve yet to hear a tale of a Knight hauling half the castle across the trials. They’re supposed to test your courage, not your endurance.”

“You always think you know better, don’t you?” William snapped, his tone sharper than he intended. He straightened, squaring his shoulders, but the weight of Matthew’s easy confidence only made him feel smaller. “I’ll pack the way I see fit.”

Matthew raised his hands in mock surrender.  “Suit yourself. But when you’re dragging that bag through mud up to your knees, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

William clenched his jaw as Matthew turned to leave, his boots clicking softly against the stone floor. The silence left behind felt heavier somehow.

“Matthew,” he called, his voice tight. “No parting words of wisdom?”

Matthew paused, glancing over his shoulder. For a moment, his grin faltered, replaced by something softer. “Just… make sure to say goodbye to Mom before we leave, okay?” Without waiting for a reply, he disappeared down the hall.

William let out a long breath, his shoulders sagging. He turned back to his belongings, the room suddenly too quiet. The walls—simple stone adorned with worn blue drapes—felt closer now, as though the weight of generations pressed against him. His gaze drifted to the lone chest, the apple sitting atop the table, and the familiar grooves in the wooden floor where his boots had paced countless times. It was hardly the room of a prince, but it had always been his.

He grabbed the apple, turning it over in his hand before biting into it. The tartness bit back, sharp and bracing. His pack sat gaping open on the bed, half-packed and accusing. With a final glance around the room, he hastily shut his pack and swung it onto his shoulder, the leather straps digging into his palms, and stepped out into the castle halls.



The apple crunched sharply under William’s teeth as he strolled through the castle halls, its tartness a brief distraction from the weight pressing on his chest. His pack hung heavily over one shoulder, its uneven bulge a testament to his frantic packing earlier. The trial of fears loomed ahead—a rite of passage for all royals and a step toward earning a place among the Knights Guardians. It was tradition, an unbroken line stretching back to Brookhaven’s earliest days, but to William, it felt more like judgment. What if I fail? The thought continued to echo.

The dark stone walls around him seemed to share his unease, their worn surfaces cracked and weathered by centuries. Faint light filtered through narrow stained-glass windows, muted reds and golds painting fleeting patterns on the faded red carpet beneath his boots. His footsteps echoed softly, a lonely sound in the cavernous space.

Family portraits lined the walls, their painted eyes unrelenting. Each ancestor stared down at him, their expressions solemn or triumphant. But some bore a different mark: black silk draped over the frames of those who had failed the trial of fears. Their names, etched in bronze plaques beneath the shrouded portraits, stood as quiet warnings. Edmund the Timid. Liora the Lost. Their faces were hidden, but their disgrace was eternal.

William’s gaze lingered on Liora’s name, his steps faltering. As a child, he had imagined her as misunderstood, a kindred spirit. Now, with the trial ahead, her name felt like an omen. He forced his eyes back to the carpet and quickened his pace. I won’t fail. I can’t.

Ahead, the towering double doors to the throne room loomed. The two guards flanking them stood stiff and silent, their polished armor catching faint slivers of light. With practiced precision, they moved to open the heavy doors, their synchronized effort almost silent save for the low groan of iron hinges.

“Prince William has entered, Your Majesties,” one of them announced, his voice ringing out across the chamber.

William straightened his back, brushing at his tunic as he stepped inside. He tossed the apple core into a bin near the door, the hollow thud echoing faintly.

The throne room was austere compared to the lavish halls he had seen in other kingdoms, but its stark simplicity carried its own kind of weight. The high, vaulted ceilings and cold stone walls gave the space an unyielding presence. Flames flickered in the great iron chandelier overhead, their light casting long shadows across the floor. The kingdom’s crest loomed behind the thrones, its bold lines a reminder of duty and tradition.

His gaze drifted to the dais further, and his heart sank. The twin seats that had stood beside the thrones, meant for him and Matthew, were gone. The empty space seemed vast, a deliberate absence that made him feel smaller. He swallowed hard, the sight a silent reminder that he and his brother no longer belonged here—not until they proved themselves worthy.

Ellis, Queen of Brookhaven, rose from her seat with a warm smile. Her auburn hair was pinned in an elegant twist, her regal bearing softened by a mother’s love. “Ah, my glorious boy,” she said, stepping forward with her arms outstretched.

William felt some of the tension ease from his shoulders. “Mother, please,” he said, though a small smile tugged at his lips. “I’m not a child anymore.”

“You’ll never outgrow your mother’s hugs, will you?” she teased, drawing him into her embrace. Her familiar scent of vanilla and lavender anchored him, a brief balm against the storm of his thoughts.

Before he could respond, a deep, gravelly voice cut through the moment. “Grow up, boy, and show some respect to your queen.”

King Brookhaven, ruler of the modest but steadfast kingdom of Brookhaven, strode into the room from a side entrance. He was a towering figure, his presence as commanding as his voice. His dark hair was streaked with silver, and his sharp features were framed by a neatly trimmed beard. Every step of his boots against the stone floor seemed deliberate, a sound designed to command attention.

“Even your brother,” the king continued, his tone clipped, “had the sense to act like a man when he visited earlier.”

The words hit their mark, and William pulled back from his mother, bowing stiffly. “Yes, Your Majesty.” He hesitated before addressing her more formally. “Your Highness.”

Ellis shot her husband a sharp look, her warmth hardening into something fierce. “Do give your sons a proper farewell, you loaf,” she said, her tone sharp enough to make even the king pause. “I will not stand next to you if this becomes our last meeting.”

King Brookhaven ignored her rebuke, his dark eyes narrowing as he turned his full attention on William. “You’ll find no comfort in the trials, boy. No soft arms to shield you. Do you even understand what’s expected of you?”

“Yes, Father,” William said quickly, though his voice quavered.

King Brookhaven stepped closer, his shadow falling over William like a shroud. “Hesitation. Doubt. Weakness. All of it will be stripped away. You will face yourself in the trial. And if you falter—” he paused, his voice dropping lower, “you will not disgrace this family, because you will no longer be part of it.”

“Brookhaven!” Ellis snapped, stepping forward, but the king held up a hand, silencing her.

“It is not cruelty,” he said, his voice cold and measured. “It is truth. The world does not wait for the weak, and neither will the crystal.”

William felt his stomach churn, his father’s words a heavy weight settling over him. He lowered his eyes, focusing on the strap of his pack as his fingers tightened around it.

Brookhaven stepped back, his tone unrelenting. “Prove me wrong,” he said. Then, turning, he ascended the platform to his throne with the finality of a judge delivering a sentence. “Leave.”

William bent to retrieve his pack, his fingers trembling. He turned to leave, the sound of his boots echoing hollowly in the vast chamber.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 2</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Travels</h3>

William made his way to the bailey, where spring was in full bloom. A garden near the castle walls exploded with color, the bright flowers a stark contrast to the gray stone of the castle. Staff bustled about, attending to the day’s work as if it were any other morning. But for William, it wasn’t just another day. His pack felt heavier with each step, its weight pressing down on him like a reminder of everything that lay ahead. What am I walking toward? he thought. My triumph? Or my failure?

No one paid him any mind as he passed. To them, he was just another young man preparing for the trials. The gravity of what he and Matthew were about to face seemed invisible to everyone else. Guess no one thinks about it until after the fact, he mused bitterly.

The bailey itself was busier than he had expected. It seemed like half the continent had turned out for the pilgrimage. Dozens of wagons, horses, and travelers from all kingdoms formed a sprawling, chaotic mass that stretched across the open yard. Merchants shouted as they loaded last-minute provisions, their voices competing with the clatter of hooves on cobblestones. A pair of blacksmiths worked furiously to repair a wagon wheel, their hammers ringing in unison. Children darted between clusters of people, laughing as they chased each other, oblivious to the gravity of the journey ahead.

“Ah, there’s my brother!” Matthew’s voice broke through William’s thoughts. He was standing by a wagon piled high with supplies, grinning as usual. “Finally! We can leave.”

Before William could reply, Matthew grabbed his pack and flung it onto the heap. “What did you pack? Bricks?” he teased, clapping William on the back. “Anyway, let me introduce you to our crew. These fine folks are Sir Marcus and Dame Carissa, our Knights of the Guardians for this journey.” He leaned in conspiratorially. “Careful—Carissa’s a bit of a wildfire.”

William’s gaze shifted to the two knights. Sir Marcus stood tall and composed, his presence commanding respect. His weathered armor bore the marks of countless battles, and his expression was unreadable, though not unkind. Beside him stood Dame Carissa, a stark contrast. She was petite, her golden hair braided neatly, but there was an energy to her—a spark in her sharp eyes that hinted at something unpredictable.

“So,” Carissa said, stepping forward and giving William a once-over. “This is the other twin. Let’s hope you’re as sharp as your brother claims to be.”

William stiffened. “And you’re as wild as he claims?”

Carissa raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at her lips. “You’ll find out soon enough.”

William exhaled, shifting his pack as he turned to take in the scene one last time. The energy of the bailey, with its swirling activity and cacophony of sounds, felt both familiar and distant now. This was the last he would see of home for a long while. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Matthew doing the same, his twin’s gaze lingering on the castle walls before flicking to the wagons assembling in the courtyard.

Sir Marcus and Dame Carissa stood a short distance away, attending to the harness of their horse. Marcus worked methodically, checking the leather straps, while Carissa rested a hand on the animal’s flank, her sharp eyes scanning the crowd as if already anticipating trouble.

Nearby, children dashed between the wagons, their wooden swords and makeshift shields clattering as they chased each other. Their laughter rang out above the hum of preparations, a bright, fleeting moment in the weight of the day.

“Are they all going to be knights?” a boy’s voice piped up from the crowd near the gate.

William turned to see a small child, his face smudged with dirt and his wooden sword tucked into a makeshift belt. He clutched a straw shield as though it were made of steel, his wide eyes darting between the travelers.

Matthew caught the question too and knelt slightly, his grin easy and warm. “Not all of them,” he said, glancing at the bustling crowd. “Only a few will make it through the trials.”

The boy frowned, clearly puzzled. “How do you become a knight? Do you fight monsters and win?”

William smirked but said nothing. Matthew, ever the patient one, answered, “It’s not just about fighting. Knights of the Guardians protect something bigger than just people.”

“What’s bigger than people?” the boy asked, tilting his head.

“The crystal,” William interjected, his voice steady. “It’s not just a treasure or a weapon. It holds the truth of balance—between kingdoms, people, even the land itself.”

The boy’s brows knitted in confusion. “What’s balance?”

Before Matthew could answer, Sir Marcus turned slightly. His voice was calm, almost somber. “Balance means sacrifice.”

The boy hesitated. “Sacrifice?”

Dame Carissa, leaning casually against a wagon, grinned but spoke more seriously than her expression suggested. “It means putting what’s right above what you want. The trials are to see if anyone here can do that.”

The boy’s gaze darted to the caravan, as if he could suddenly spot the ones who would succeed. “So it’s like a big test?” he asked, his tone laced with awe.

“It’s more than a test,” Matthew said, standing to his full height again. “It’s a way of life. The trials don’t just find warriors—they find those who can carry the weight of the crystal’s truth.”

The boy’s face scrunched in thought. “And what happens if you fail?”

No one answered.

A horn sounded, low and deep, cutting through the noise of the bailey. The knights moved into position, Marcus climbing onto his horse while Carissa motioned to the wagon drivers to form up. The murmurs of the crowd grew quieter as the travelers assembled.

Sir Marcus cleared his throat, breaking the tension. “If we’re all acquainted, we should be moving. The road ahead isn’t as safe as it used to be.” He glanced at William and Matthew, his tone firm. “Stay sharp, boys. The journey to the sacred grounds is just the beginning.”

Matthew placed a hand on William’s shoulder. “Looks like it’s time,” he said softly. His easy grin was back, but there was an edge to it now, a quiet tension that William recognized all too well.

The boy watched as the caravan began to shift and move, the wagons creaking into motion and horses stepping forward in rhythm. He lingered near the gate, his straw shield drooping slightly as the group passed. William caught his gaze one last time, the boy’s earlier excitement now replaced with a quiet sense of wonder—and maybe a touch of fear.

The crowd thinned as the caravan moved beyond the gates, their chatter fading into the open road. The sacred grounds lay ahead, and the air seemed to grow heavier as they left the safety of the castle behind.

As they began to move, William noticed the other travelers falling into line. It was a diverse crowd, far larger than he had anticipated. Some rode on horseback or in wagons; others walked, their packs slung over their shoulders. The caravan stretched nearly the length of the bailey.

At the front, a pair of armored siblings—Eleanor and Halric—rode side by side. Their polished steel glinted in the sunlight, and their matching crests marked them as nobles from another kingdom William and Matthew once visited as children. Eleanor’s expression was sharp and focused, while Halric seemed to enjoy the attention their presence drew.

A short distance behind them, a wiry youth named Elric strummed a lute as he walked, his tuneless humming cutting through the chatter. His companion, a tall woman named Hana, carried a bow almost as tall as herself. She kept an amused eye on Elric, rolling her eyes whenever his songs grew too outlandish.

Not far behind was Tobias, a broad-shouldered farmer whose nervousness was palpable. He carried a staff, though he wielded it like a plow handle. His clothes were practical and patched, and he seemed constantly distracted by his surroundings.

“This is madness,” Tobias muttered, his voice low but carrying. “I should be back home planting for the harvest.”

“You volunteered,” a voice teased from beside him.

Tobias groaned. “A fool’s choice. My brothers wouldn’t let me live it down if I stayed.”

William caught Marcus’s smirk as he listened. “Courage comes in many forms,” Marcus said lightly, addressing Tobias. “Even if you’re terrified.”

“Not terrified,” Tobias snapped defensively, but his trembling hands betrayed him. “Just cautious.”

“That caution might save you yet.” Carissa interjected, hoping to waver the man's wavering feelings.

But it was the figure near the tree line that caught William’s attention most. Cloaked in crimson, they moved with unsettling grace, always just within the shadows. Their presence felt like a whisper at the edge of his awareness—impossible to ignore yet difficult to focus on.

“Who is that?” William asked, his voice low.

Matthew followed his line of sight, his expression narrowing as he studied the distant silhouette. “I don’t know,” he said, his tone more serious than William expected. “But don’t get distracted. We have enough to worry about without chasing shadows.”

But William couldn’t shake the feeling that this figure wasn’t like the others. Their movements seemed too deliberate, too fluid, as though they were gliding rather than walking. Whenever William looked their way, he felt as though they were looking back, even though their face was hidden.

“Stay sharp,” Matthew added, his voice quieter now. But his words did nothing to ease the knot forming in William’s stomach.

## 💜 Final thoughts from Daisy

I have to give a huge shoutout to Voldex—this is their first update with a **secret quest**, and wow did they deliver! What makes it even more special is how they wove in pieces of existing Brookhaven lore. Longtime players had that "aha!" moment, while new ones got to experience that spark of discovery for the first time.

But the best part? Watching the community rally together again—just like before. Players swapping theories, sharing screenshots, solving steps side by side... and honestly, making new friends along the way. That’s the real Brookhaven magic to me. 💫

As for that **404 signal**... I’m very curious who it was meant for—and what it just set in motion. 👀

**PS:** Thank you, *Wolfpaq*, for showing Voldex what the magic of Brookhaven is really about. 💜

See you on set, detectives.

**BloominDaisy 💜**

To all the Brookhaven explorers, puzzle-solvers, and secret-seekers:

After years of sharing stories, walkthroughs, and magical moments, it's time for me to step away from this site and say a heartfelt goodbye.

This decision hasn't been easy. The community we’ve built together has been one of the most joyful parts of my life online. You've helped each other find hidden buttons, decode riddles, and explore every inch of Brookhaven’s mysteries. I'm endlessly proud of what we've uncovered together.

Over time, I’ve found myself reassessing the broader trajectory of the platform and its evolving approach to user engagement. While I’ve always supported initiatives that foster curiosity, creativity, and community, recent trends have introduced new dynamics that prompted reflection on my role in that ecosystem.

As the landscape shifts, so too do the definitions of player insight and participation. And while innovation is essential, it’s equally important to remain aligned with core values—particularly when those innovations intersect with a uniquely young and impressionable audience.

After careful consideration, I’ve chosen to step back. Part of this is simply life—my time and focus are needed in other places. But it’s also a values-based decision. As the intentions behind my work begin to feel increasingly distant from the strategies shaping the community experience, I know it’s time to let this chapter rest.

So, as of today:

- This site will **no longer be updated**, but it will **remain online** as a reference for players around the world.
- I am **not seeking contributors or successors** at this time.
- I will not be responding to offers, inquiries, or sponsorships from any developers or partners.

I want to be clear: this isn’t a statement against Brookhaven or the people who continue to love and build within it. It’s simply a personal decision.

To the Brookhaven Secrets and Mysteries community—thank you. For the notes you shared, the secrets you chased, and the spirit of collaboration that made this journey unforgettable. This space has always been built on your passion as much as mine.

Though I’ll no longer be writing here, I still love a good mystery. You might find me in-game once in a while, sleuthing for fun or pondering lore in quiet curiosity. No updates, no obligations—just wonder.

If you’re a young fan reading this: thank you for your imagination. Stay safe, ask big questions, and never stop exploring with kindness. You are the reason I created this site in the first place.

With love and a grateful heart,  
**Daisy**
